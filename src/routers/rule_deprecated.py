    Get the current text of a specific rule.

    Because this end point was designed to be human-friendly, responses for rules in the Keyword and Keyword Action
    sections may return a different rule than what was queried.

    *Example:* A user looking for the definition of defender might search for rule 702.3 (perhaps due to a glossary
    reference). That rule however simply says "Defender", which isn't particularly useful. To try and give a useful
    response, the API will look into the subrules to find one that actually provides a definition of that keyword.
    702.3a simply states defender is a static ability, which doesn't help much either, so the text of 702.3b will be
    what's actually returned by the call.

    To check what rule was actually returned, use the `ruleNumber` field of the response. To disable this behavior
    entirely, set the `exact_match` query parameter to `true`.
