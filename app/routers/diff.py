    """
    Returns a diff of the CR between the two specified sets. Diffs only exist for neighboring CR releases.

    The set code query parameters are **not** case sensitive. If both are supplied, the server attempts to find a
    diff between exactly those two sets. If only one is supplied, a diff with that set at the provided end is found.
    If neither is supplied, the latest CR diff is returned.

    The `changes` property is an ordered array of diff items, with each item consisting of the `old` and `new`
    versions of a rule. If a new rule is added, `old` is `null`. If an old rule is deleted, `new` is `null`.
    Otherwise, the differing parts of the `ruleText` string are wrapped between "<<<<" and ">>>>". Rules with
    identical text but changed rule number aren't part of this array, and neither are rules whose only change in text
    was a reference to a renumbered rule.

    The `moves` property contains an ordered array representing the rules that changed their number but didn't change
    their content. This property may be `null` or missing. If present, each element in the array is a dictionary with
    strings describing `from` which number `to` which number the rule moved. of strings, containing the old and new
    numbers for the given rule. No items that are part of the `changes` property are included here. In particular,
    this means that both values are always present and not `null` nor empty.

    `sourceSet` and `destSet` contain full names of the sets being diffed, and `sourceCode` and `destCode` contain
    the canonical set codes of those sets. If the `nav` query parameter is set to `true`, an optional `nav` property
    is added to the response, containing codes of sets in the preceding and following diffs (if such diffs exist).
